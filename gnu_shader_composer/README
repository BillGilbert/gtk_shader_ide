This app could be build [and was tested] on GNU/Linux, Windoze [using MinGW or Cygwin]. 

In order to run this crap, do the following:
	1. run autogen.sh in this [top level dir]
	2. run make
	3. copy the gnu_shader_composer.glade file into the src dir
	4. change to the src dir and run gnu_shader_composer.exe
	5. there is no point 5
